# 🗣️ Stammer Detection and Fluency Analysis Web App

A production-ready Flask web application that detects stammering from audio recordings using a pre-trained ML model. It also generates a detailed fluency report including stammering patterns, fluency score, and time-series visualizations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ **Browser-based audio recording**
- 🧠 **Stammer detection** using pre-trained models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, StutterNet)
- 📊 **Fluency score** calculation and severity level classification
- 📈 **Pattern analysis**: word repetitions, prolongations, blocks, and frequency
- ☁️ **Visual reports** with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- 🌐 Clean and interactive **Flask-based frontend**

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Librosa, PyDub, Numpy, Wav2Vec2 / CNN-LSTM
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Web Audio API)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Audio Models**: Wav2Vec2.0 / StutterNet / Custom ML models
